# brunscii's (Chris's) github

Hi, my name is chris. I am a web developer that is always looking to learn. The more we know, the quicker we can pick up new skills. 

Some things I really like
- SCSS
- jQuery
- C++ 
- C#
- Python

My love of programming goes back to my first year of college in 2008, when I took a class in C++. 
I learned C++, C#, Java, Python 2.6, and VB.NET in community college before transferring to UNCW. There, I learned data structures, algorithms, ASM, digital arts, and some of the more conceptual bits of computer science. At the time UNCW used Java almost exclusively. 

I later learned Python 3.X, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and REACT on my own using resources like freeCodeCamp, MDN, youtube, and tons of practice.

I love to learn and create new things. I often find that you will truly realize how little you know about something when you start building from scratch.
