# brunscii's (Chris's) github

Hi, my name is Chris and I'm a Web Developer/Data Analyst that is always looking to learn. The more we know, the quicker we can pick up new skills. 

I ‚ô•Ô∏è markdown and writting code

My love of programming goes back to my first year of college in 2008 when I took a class in C++. I instantly fell in love with the ability to create and solve problems that programming gave me. 
I learned C++, C#, Java, Python 2.5, and VB.NET at the local college. There I also took plenty of IT courses and learned the ins-and-outs of linux, networking, and hardware. Later I transferred to UNCW where I learned data structures, algorithms, ASM, digital arts, and some of the more conceptual bits of computer science. 

In more recent years I have learned Python 3.X, SQL, Pandas, HTML, (s)CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, React and more on my own using resources like freeCodeCamp, MDN, youtube, Coursera, and tons of practice.
