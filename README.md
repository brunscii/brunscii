# brunscii's (Chris's) github

Hi, my name is chris. I am a web developer that is always looking to learn. The more we know the quicker we can pick up new skills. 

Some things I really like
- SCSS
- jQuery
- C++ 
- C#
- Python

My love of programming goes back to my first year of college in 2008, when I took a class in C++. 
I learned C++, C#, Java, Python 2.6, and VB.NET in community college before transfering to UNCW. There I learned data structures, algorithms, ASM, digital arts, and more conceptual bits of computer science.

I later learned Python 3.X, JavaScript, HTML and CSS on my own using resources like freeCodeCamp, MDN, youtube, and tons of practice
